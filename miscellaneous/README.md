# Miscellaneous scripts #

These are miscellaneous management scripts that I've written to handle certain situations.

* maintain_ard_privs.sh configures ARD's authorized users
* update_lpadmin.sh adjusts the lpadmin group to allow specified users to add/remove printers or resume/pause printing
* set-name.sh sets the machine name and enables the loginwindowtext feature
* vpn-menu-item: a script and a launchagent plist to ensure that the vpn menu item is displayed for any user of that machine
